John is an alien. He is currently running for president of the United States.
John thought no one knew his true identity. However, the fact is obvious to everyone, because John had four arms.
Under such circumstances, John has to reveal that he is actually helping the Earth. Because he's a pacifist, but the other aliens on John's planet are planning to attack the Earth. He's running for president in order to build a protective cover to keep other aliens away.
John tries to raise money from his country. However, no one believes him. John amazingly wins the election race, no one thought it could
be done! Once in office he somehow convinced the aliens to themselves build the protective cover and pay for it! 

And so the earth was saved! 
THE END
